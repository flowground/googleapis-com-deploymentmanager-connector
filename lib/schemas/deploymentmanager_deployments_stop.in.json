This ensures optimistic concurrency so that the deployment does not have conflicting requests (e.g. if someone attempts to make a new update request while another user attempts to stop an ongoing update request, this would prevent a collision).\n\nThe fingerprint is initially generated by Deployment Manager and changes after every request to modify a deployment. To get the latest fingerprint value, perform a get() request on the deployment.",
